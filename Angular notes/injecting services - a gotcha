in angular, a service can only be injected into a class that has some 'metadata', 
examples of metadata include @Component, @Directive, etc..

to inject a service into another service, the 'metadata' that you include on the receiving service is @Injectable()
nothing needs to be added to the service that will be injected, just the receiving service
