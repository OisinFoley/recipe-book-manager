We can write a function that will set our:

store,
router,
fixture,
component 
and componentHtmlElement

for us, so that we don't have to write them line-by-line at the end of each beforeEach block.

We just need to ensure it is generic.
Below is how to do so:

'Type' is imported from @angular/core;

Arrow (note the <T> at beginning and end of next line):
const setTestProps = <T>(TestBedSetup: TestBedStatic, componentClass: Type<T>) => {

  const store = TestBedSetup.get<Store<fromApp.AppState>>(Store);
  const router = TestBedSetup.get(Router);
  *** NOTE THE <T> ON THIS LINE ***
  const fixture = TestBedSetup.createComponent<T>(componentClass);
  const component = fixture.componentInstance;
  const componentHtmlElement = fixture.debugElement.nativeElement;

  return {
    store,
    router,
    fixture,
    component,
    componentHtmlElement
  };

}

Non-arrow (note the <T> at beginning and end of next line):
function setTestProps<T>(TestBedSetup: TestBedStatic, componentClass: Type<T>) {... the rest is the same }
