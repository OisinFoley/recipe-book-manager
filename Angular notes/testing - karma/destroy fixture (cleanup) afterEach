- describe block should have a declaration, like so:

let fixture:      ComponentFixture<ShoppingListComponent>;

- beforeEach should have an assignment, like so:

fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ShoppingListComponent);

- afterEach should use either fo the following:

	fixture.debugElement.nativeElement.remove();
or
	document.body.removeChild(element);


Note: Some examples mention     "fixture.destroy();"
It doesn't work for us, could be a versioning issue, but either way, avoid it...
