This can occur intermittently when mocking the return value of one of the HttpClient's methods.

The problem is that we are returning some sort of mock value, without returning it an Observable.

We just need to wrap our return value in an of() operator and it'll pass consistently.

Example:

From
httpService.get.and.returnValue(populatedMockRecipes);

to
httpService.get.and.returnValue(of(populatedMockRecipes));
