You can use Katja's answer from the above link to reuse TestBed setup in different beforeEach blocks -> the idea is to have a main outer describe block, which does the configureTestingModule setup each time.
Then, you have multiple inner beforeEach blocks which initialise the fixture, store, router, componentInstance, etc.
