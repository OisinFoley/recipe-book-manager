- you may have defined a spy in a beforeEach block, like so:

closeRecipeSpy = spyOn(component, 'onCloseRecipe');

- if you want to redefine it at the beginning of a single test, you will get an error if you say closeRecipeSpy = spyOn(....) related to there already being a spy.

Instead of redefining it, you just update the value, like so:

closeRecipeSpy.and.callThrough();
or
closeRecipeSpy.and.returnValue();

// you just make the call on the existing variable itself
