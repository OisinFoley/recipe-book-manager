A template is rendered asynchronously unless it is an inline template (templating defined within the component.ts file itself.
Many examples online say to call .compileComponents() and inside of its then() callback, assign the fixture and component like so:

TestBed.compileComponents()
.then(() => {
       fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ShoppingListComponent);
       component = fixture.componentInstance;
});

*THE ABOVE ISN'T HOW I GOT IT TO WORK*

----------------------------------------------------------------

The way I got this to work is to just assign the fixture and component synchronously, like so:

TestBed.compileComponents();
fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ShoppingListComponent);
component = fixture.componentInstance;
