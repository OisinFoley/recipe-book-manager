If not concerned with interacting with a route other than the one belonging to the component that's rendered at the beginning of the test, then using this blank withRoutes() config will work

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [
	RouterTestingModule.withRoutes([]),
	... other angular modules like formsmodule, etc.
      ],
      declarations: [
	... components
      ],
      providers: [
        ... store mock or whatever
      ],
    });
