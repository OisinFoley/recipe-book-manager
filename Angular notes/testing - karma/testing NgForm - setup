There's 2 differences to a basic test:

- when we define a test, we normally do it like so:
it('should create the app', async(() => {

with NgForm, we actually do it it like this (not, fakeAsync):
it('should create the app', fakeAsync(() => {

- secondly, we have to manually call tick(), which is a built-in func that defers the execution of the rest of the test until the form elements have loaded (without this, you will get an error related to the controls being undefined or that the form itself is empty):

const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ShoppingEditComponent);
fixture.detectChanges();

tick();

// Since, we called tick(), we can update the slForm prop (which is of type NgForm) without any issue.

const app: ShoppingEditComponent = fixture.componentInstance;

app.slForm.setValue({
        name: name,
        amount: amount
});
