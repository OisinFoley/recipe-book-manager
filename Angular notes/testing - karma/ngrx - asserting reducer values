Esnure to use .toEqual instead of .toBe so that you get deep equality checking.
Otherwise, your assertions might fail.

Important to keep this in mind, because we would have used .toBe when testing a lot of component logic outside of ngrx, so it's easy to subconciously use the same equality assertion function
