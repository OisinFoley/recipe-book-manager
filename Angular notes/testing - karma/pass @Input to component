If you have a recipe-item component, and it has both a 'recipe' and 'index' @Input, do the following:

const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(RecipeItemComponent);
const component: RecipeItemComponent = fixture.componentInstance;
const index = 0;

component.recipe = mockRecipe[index];
component.index = index;
fixture.detectChanges();

// after that, the inputs have been bound to the class members
