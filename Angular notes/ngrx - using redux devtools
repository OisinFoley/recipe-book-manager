install @ngrx/store-devtools

in your app module's import statements, add this line:

// import your environment file (not env.production)
StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument({ logOnly: environment.production }),

What this says is:
- when you're running in production, the CLI will copy the content of env.production into the regular env file.
- if the env file's production property is true, then only show logs
- I haven't booted the app in both dev and production in order to see the difference, but that's the general premise accoriding to Max

(TODO: check out the difference in the extension's output when running in dev vs production)
