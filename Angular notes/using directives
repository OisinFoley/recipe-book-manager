there are some build-in directives, one of whih is ngIf
it is defined with an asterisk, *ngIf="serverCreated", the asterisk meaning it is a structural directive and directly interacts with the DOM (i.e. adds or removes, as opposed to hiding visibility of an element)

to do a false check, you can do an *ngIf="!someProp"
OR
when defining your truthy if value, do this

*ngIf="someProp; else noServer" ,then we directly define a template wherever we would liek the alternative templating to be displayed

full example:

<p *ngIf="someProp; else noServer"> something </p>
<ng-template #noServer>
  <p> not something </p>
</ng-template>

*ngIf (in truthy and falsy form) is the example you're most likely to use according to the instructor of the angular 8 course
