Our child module needs to export the component declarations so that the app module can be made aware of them.

If your child module has its own routing.module file, then you do not need to explicitly export your declarations in your child.module.ts file.

Do not need this in your @NgModule decorator:
 exports: [
    RecipesComponent,
    RecipeListComponent,
    RecipeDetailComponent,
    RecipeItemComponent,
    RecipeStartComponent,
    RecipeEditComponent
  ]

This is because your child module's components will be exposed through its routing module.
Your routing file declares what components are associated with what route.

And your child module's import property (in NgModule decorator) contains your routing module.
The contents of this routing module (and by extension your child module's components) will be exposed when we export the child module class, and import that child modules class into our app module

imports: [
    RouterModule,
    CommonModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
    RecipesRoutingModule // child module imports this and exposes components
  ],
