<my-comp>
	<some-other-templating>
<my-comp>

by default angular will ignore the some-other-templating when inside my-comp
the way to get the some-other-templating into my-comp is to decide where in my-comp you
would like to display this dynamic templating, and place the following directive:
	<ng-content> </ng-content>
