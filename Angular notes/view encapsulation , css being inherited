in Angular, if you define a style in app.css,
then child components don't actually inherit that styling
Angular is designed in a way that the styling logic is encapsulated spcifically within the file it was defined in

(how to get around this may come later...)

in a .component file's @Component decorator,
define the following:

encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None

a style defined here can bubble up and be applied to a sibling component
	a
b		c
style defined in 'c', will be applied to 'b'

What ViewEncapsulation.None does is essentially apply a global style, so even back up in the parent, the style defined in the child will be enforced (i.e. - better order of specificity)
Of course, if we defined a color style for p elements in a child component, as well as in a parent, the styling in the parent will be enforced in the parent.
But, if there is no color styling for p elements in the parent, then the global styling defined in the child will be applied to the parent

this isn't necessarily something you'd want to mess around with, but it's something to be aware of

-------------------------

Doesn't say how to ensure a style defined in the parent propagates down to the child ?
