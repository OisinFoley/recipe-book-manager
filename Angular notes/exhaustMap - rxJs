exhaustMap is a function which allows you to take an observable, and return an updated / modified observable

- Initially, you have an observable, and then you pipe the observable.
- Inside of pipe's params, you pass in exhaustMap.
- exhaustMap is called as a function, and inside the braces of our exhaustMap function,
	you return whatever you want.
- Back at the point where you called yourObservable.pipe(....), 
	you put a return in front of yourObservable, ensuring that whatever is returned inside 		your exhaustMap is returned as your updated observable.
