the prop on the left (inside a square bracket) is what we are about to set,
and the value on the right is the component property we want to pass in as the value
see below example, we grab srcURL from component and assign it as the img element's src

class {
    this.srcURL = "http://pexels/image.jpg"
}

<img [src]="srcURL" />
    |
    |
<img src="http://pexels/image.jpg" />

to put something between oopening and closing tag, we use interpolation {{something}} as before
