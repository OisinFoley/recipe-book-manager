to define a service, you just create a regular class with some functions you can call

to consume said service, we import the service class into the consuming component,
and instead of instantiating an instance with the new Object() ctor, we do the following:

- add a providers prop to the @Component decorator, and add the service to be consumed inside of an array [ServiceName]

- pass the service in as a dependency into your ctor, hence dependency injection
(just passing in the service as an arg will automatically assign a prop with that name to your component, meaning you don't have to do a C#-like ctor whereby you say 
function (string name) {
	this.name = name; // this is implicitly don for you
}

- then when you want to consume the service, call this.serviceAlias.funcToBeCalled()
