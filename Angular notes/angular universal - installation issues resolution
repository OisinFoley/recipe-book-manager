If on angular cli 8 or above, and you try adding it using:

ng add @nguniversal/express-engine --clientProject {{ recipe-name in angular.json }}

you'll get a 'kind' undefined error that will prevent some necessary files from being auto-generated.

You can fix it by running:

npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@8.0

followed by

ng add @nguniversal/express-engine --clientProject {â€Œ{ name }}

That should work.
