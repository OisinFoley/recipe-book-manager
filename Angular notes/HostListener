a way to listen for events on the DOM and react to them in combination with Renderer2

e.g. - 

this example was used in a directive, and at this time, I think it can only be used there and not in components

@HostListener('mouseenter') mouseover(eventData: Event) {
    this.renderer.setStyle(this.elRef.nativeElement, 'background-color', 'blue');
}

we listen for a hover on an element, then combine it with Renderer2 to change a DOM element
