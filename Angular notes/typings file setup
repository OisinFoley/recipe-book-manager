Sometimes you get warnings when using a package that the compiler cannot find a @types/packageName package.

If you don't want to install the typings file, you can just add a declaration to a typings file of your own, and th warning will go away.

If the package in question is alertifyjs, adding:
	declare module 'alertifyjs'
to a file called (for example) typings.d.ts will get the error to go away

If you've just created that file in your app, update your tsconfig.json like so:

"typeRoots": [
      "node_modules/@types",
      "src/typings.d.ts"
],
