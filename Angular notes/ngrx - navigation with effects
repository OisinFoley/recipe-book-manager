This is how you handle route navigation outside of templates when using NgRx.

W/o NgRx, this would have been done in the component, inside the callback to some sort of behavior subject subscriber.

  @Effect({ dispatch: false })
  authSuccess = this.actions$.pipe(
    ofType(AuthActions.LOGIN),
    tap(() => {
      this.router.navigate(['/']);
    })
  );
