the prop receiving the prop must still have a prop marked as an @Input() in its component file,
BUT when the parent is passing in a prop that is a string (this only applies to strings),
you can pass the prop without defining the prop in square brackets.

so you can do <my-comp name="user.name"> instead of <my-comp [name]="user.name">

this is ONLY TRUE FOR STRINGS
