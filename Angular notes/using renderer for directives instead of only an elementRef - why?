in the directives deep dive section of the course, we see a 'basic directive' approach - which is discouraged - as well as a 'better directive'

the basic approach directly accesses an elementRef's nativeElement.
this can be troulesome if using service workers, as the service worker will have not access to the DOM, which is what directly using elementRef.nativeElement does.

if we use the 'better directive', we can handle the scenariod where we do/don't have DOM access
in the better directive, we also define an Renderer2 type in the ctor

Note: Renderer2 is a class used to setstyles before a DOM or DOM-like tree has been put in place, hence why we could use it in a service worker.
The '2' means nothing special, it's just an evolution on what the original Renderer type was.
Renderer is an @angular/core type

With the above in mind, the Renderer type should be used for DOM manipulation
