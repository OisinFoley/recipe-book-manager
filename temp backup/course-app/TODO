Make backup of repo state from just before you started NgRx section, as this repo state still contains all the notes comments which show alternative approaches, such as using ElementRefs to grab elements, @ViewChilds, EventEmitters and whatever else you may find.

It's good to have a backup repo to look back on after we tidy up the main repo and remove all those old comments from the main repo

We want to have 2 repos, 1 with notes (private) and 1 without notes
Repo without notes will have 2 branches of the app (w/ and w/o NgRx):

- 1 which still has all the comments, alternative approaches that we can see if we navigate through the the app's services and components at any commit just before starting the NgRx section.

- Another which has all the comments/notes removed and is the code that just uses subjects to manage state (this will be without the animations and sections that came after the bonus NgRx section in the course)
This is important to keep so that we can revise this approach and be familiar with a non-store based approach in interviews

- The main app, which will have the NgRx approach, as well as the animations and additions that appear in sections which came after the course's NgRx section.
This version is going to be the master branch
